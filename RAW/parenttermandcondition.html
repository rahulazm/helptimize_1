<p>
<b>Description.</b><br> The Service is proprietary to Helptimize and is protected by intellectual property laws and international intellectual property treaties.
User's access to the Service is limited to those users over the age of 14. However, if between 14 and 18 years old the user is required to be linked to a custodial account who is responsible for the signing of contracts within the Helptimize app.  By clicking below you are agreeing that you are either over 18 years old, between 14 and 18 years old or not yet 14 years old.  If under 14 years old unfortunately labor laws prohibit your ability to provide or request services on the Helptimize app or Desktop software.  If between 14 and 18 years old you will need to register/link the account with a custodial guardian account who can sign contracts submitted by you (14-18 years old minor). If you accept that your age is between 14 & 18 years old and have a valid custodial guardian account who is over 18 years old they will be notified by our system to agree to additional terms and services agreement to link your account to theirs where all submittals of service requests or bids to services by the minor between 14 & 18 years will require the custodial guardian agreeing to the contract by submitting the request of bid.
