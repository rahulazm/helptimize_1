<strong> </strong>

<strong>IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SET FORTH BELOW CAREFULLY, AS IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH HELPTIMIZE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. BY ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND HAVE TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IMPORTANT DECISION.</strong>

<strong> </strong>
<h4>Arbitration Agreement</h4>
<strong>By agreeing to the Terms, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against Helptimize on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. This will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against Helptimize or it’s parent company </strong><strong>BrainConnexion LLC</strong><strong>, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against Helptimize by someone else.</strong>
<h5>Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Helptimize.</h5>
You and Helptimize agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or (b) your access to or use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the date you agreed to the Terms, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Helptimize, and not in a court of law.

You acknowledge and agree that you and Helptimize are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Unless both you and Helptimize otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding. However, you and Helptimize each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.
<h5>Rules and Governing Law.</h5>
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.

The parties agree that the arbitrator (“Arbitrator”), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.

Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of California.
<h5>Process.</h5>
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration Rules at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of Washington and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
<h5>Location and Procedure.</h5>
Unless you and Helptimize otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Helptimize submit to the Arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
<h5>Arbitrator's Decision.</h5>
The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. An Arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties. An Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Helptimize will not seek, and hereby waives all rights Helptimize may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if Helptimize prevails in arbitration.
<h5>Fees.</h5>
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $50,000, Helptimize will pay all such fees, unless the Arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
<h5>Changes.</h5>
Notwithstanding the provisions in Section I above, regarding consent to be bound by amendments to these Terms, if Helptimize changes this Arbitration Agreement after the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to the Terms), you may reject any such change by providing Helptimize written notice of such rejection within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Effective" date above. This written notice must be provided either (a) by mail or hand delivery to our registered agent for service of process, _________________ in Nevada (the name and current contact information for the registered agent in each state are available online <a href="https://ct.wolterskluwer.com/sop-locations">here</a>), or (b) by email from the email address associated with your Account to: <a href="mailto:jeff.mcbroom@helptimize.com">jeff.mcbroom@helptimize.com</a> . In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Arbitration Agreement. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Helptimize in accordance with the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to the Terms).
<h5>Severability and Survival.</h5>
If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

&nbsp;

User Accounts.

&nbsp;

In order to use most aspects of the Services, you must register for and maintain an active personal user Services account (“Account”). <strong>To obtain an “Account”, you must be at least 18 years of age to sign contracts within the Helptimize platform. However, if you are between ages 14 &amp; 18 years old then you are eligible to register an account with a legal custodian parent/guardian to have a “Linked Account”. The legal custodian for any User between 14 -18 years old (minor) will be required to sign legal Helptimize contracts on the platform submitted by the minor in order to authorize a request for service or bid on service as long as all jurisdictional laws have been met.  Teenagers between 14 and 18 will need to have a legal custodial parent/guardian sign a waiver to be directly responsible for the actions of the minor on the platform and not hold Helptimize accountable for any damages in accordance with the legal adult custodian parent/guardian waiver agreement for any services offered or requested by the minor.</strong>

&nbsp;

Account registration requires you to submit to Helptimize certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number and age, as well as at least one valid payment method (either a credit card or accepted payment partner). You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access and use the Services or Helptimize’s termination of these Terms with you. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by Helptimize in writing, you may only possess one Account.

&nbsp;

It is agreed that Requestors of Services utilize the platform for services needed and not uses for the sole purpose of receiving quotes.  Users also authorize that Helptimize track usage of the platform and calculate the submit to award ratio for service requested.  If said submit to award ratio drops below 60% then Users authorize the platform to list the account as a quote center and charge the quote center accounts a fee listed on <a href="http://www.helptimize.com">www.helptimize.com</a> website for requesting a service on Helptimize platform.  This quote center money will be distributed to a portion of the bidders and Helptimize for providing quotes.  From time to time Helptimize will re-evaluate the charges levied with Quote Center Accounts to help maintain interest from sellers to provide only quotes.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Helptimize will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.

The ICC Rules' Emergency Arbitrator provisions are excluded. The Dispute shall be resolved by one (1) arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules. The place of both mediation and arbitration shall be in the State of Washington in The United States of America, without prejudice to any rights you may have under any other articles.  The language of the mediation and/or arbitration shall be English, unless you do not spe­ak English, in which case the mediation and/or arbitration shall be conducted in both English and your native language. The existence and content of the mediation and arbitration proceedings, including documents and briefs submitted by the parties, correspondence from and to the International Chamber of Commerce, correspondence from the mediator, and correspondence, orders and awards issued by the sole arbitrator, shall remain strictly confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party without the express written consent from the other party unless: (i) the disclosure to the third party is reasonably required in the context of conducting the mediation or arbitration proceedings; and (ii) the third party agrees unconditionally in writing to be bound by the confidentiality obligation stipulated herein.
